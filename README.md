Air Data Computer

Description
An air data computer (ADC) is an essential avionics component found in modern aircraft. This unit can determine True Airspeed, Mach number, Altitude, and common air properties from a pitot-static probe data and an outside air temperature probe.

This repository, together with the media published on the BasicAirData website, contains the information to build from scratch a recreational grade DIY Air Data Computer. This device can transmit data via USB serial port and Bluetooth, and log all data on a MicroSD.

The project is a work in progress
